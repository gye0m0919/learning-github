## Project Description

This project implements a tool for taking photos using a webcam. It primarily uses the webcam to take photos in real-time or perform related functions.

## Files and Contents

- The result window indicates whether a photo has been taken through the message 'Photo saved.'
- Press the 'esc' key to close the webcam.

### final_webcam.py

- **Initial completed code.**
- Photo capture functionality is not implemented.
- It runs with the webcam, continuously displaying the number of people detected in the execution window.
- Press the 'esc' key to close the webcam.

### mosiac.py

- **Reference code implementing mosaic functionality.**

### opensource_capture.py

- **Reference source code implementing webcam capture.**

### Motivation

When taking photos, unwanted subjects or other people are sometimes captured. To prevent this inconvenience of manually covering or using mosaics, we implemented it in Python.
